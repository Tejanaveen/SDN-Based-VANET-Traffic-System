# SDN-Based-VANET-Traffic-System

Road accidents caused by adverse weather conditions such as fog and snow present significant challenges to road safety and emergency response efforts.
Reduced visibility and dangerous driving conditions increase the likelihood of accidents that requires efficient emergency response systems.
Conventional communication systems has vehicle-to-vehicle notification that lack in providing timely alerts and coordinating emergency responses during harsh weather conditions.
This leads to increased risks for drivers and delays in emergency services' ability to respond effectively.
The primary motivation behind our project is to enhance road safety in adverse weather conditions.
We aim to reduce the number of accidents and improve emergency response times via implementing advanced technologies.
Our primary objective is to develop a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) based intelligent traffic management system.
This system will integrate the SOS system in vehicles with government infrastructure to enhance emergency response capabilities.
